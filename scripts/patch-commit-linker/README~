Match email patches to their appropriate commit

*Extract lines from git: You run the parsePatches.pl on a git log with patches. This generates a
file. 

git clone <name of repo>
git log -p --after={2012-11-30} --before={2013-01-01} | ./parsePatches.pl > linuxhistory.in

*Create a db to dump linuxhistory into and dump linuxhistory: With that file you
create a sqlite database (lineslinus.db) For linux is will take hours...
depending on how fast your computer is.

sqlite3 lineslinus.db

CREATE TABLE line(cid char(40), filename varchar(140), linetype char, line text);

.separator ';'
.import linuxhistory.in line

CREATE INDEX lineidx on line(line, linetype, filename);
CREATE INDEX lineidx2 on line(cid);


*Run searchMatch.pl with the database in the same directory as the lineslinus.db

KLUDGE: we are trimming whitespace, otherwise there were no matches

cat <location with files> | ./searchMatch.pl > mailmatch.out

*Future work: ideally searchMatch should compute jaccard and use it to determine the closest match.
