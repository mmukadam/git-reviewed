From Daniel's email message:

Here are two scripts. One extracts the lines, and the other searches
them.

You run the parsePatches.pl on a git log with patches. This generates a
file. With that file you create a sqlite database (lineslinus.db) with
the following schema:

CREATE TABLE line(cid char(40), filename varchar(140), linetype char, line text);
CREATE INDEX lineidx on line(line, linetype, filename);
CREATE INDEX lineidx2 on line(cid);

For linux is will take hours... depending on how fast your computer is.

then you run searchMatch.pl with the database in the same directory as
the executable.

ideally searchMatch should compute jaccard (but I was too lazy to do it
:) and use it to determine the closest match.
